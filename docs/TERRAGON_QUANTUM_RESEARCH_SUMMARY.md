## 🔍 Research Motivation & Problem Statement

### Current Limitations in Neural Operators

1. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Existing neural operators struggle with high-dimensional PDEs (>1000³ resolution)
2. **Long-Range Dependencies**: Classical attention mechanisms fail to capture global dependencies in turbulent flows
3. **Static Architectures**: Current models cannot adapt to changing problem complexity
4. **Local Optima Trapping**: Gradient-based optimization gets stuck in suboptimal solutions

### Our Solution: Quantum-Inspired Enhancement

We propose a revolutionary approach combining:
- **Quantum Superposition**: Neural states exist in superposition until measurement
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Long-range correlations through Bell-state-like mechanisms  
- **Quantum Annealing**: Global optimization through quantum tunneling
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Self-improving architectures based on performance feedback

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulation

### Quantum Superposition Layer

The quantum superposition layer maintains neural states in coherent superposition:

```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|φᵢ⟩

where αᵢ ∈ ℂ are complex amplitudes satisfying Σᵢ|αᵢ|² = 1
```

**Implementation:**
```python
quantum_states = amplitudes * torch.exp(1j * phases)
x_complex = x.unsqueeze(1) * quantum_states.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)
measured = torch.real(torch.sum(x_complex, dim=1))
```

### Quantum Entanglement Mechanism

Long-range dependencies through Bell-pair-like correlations:

```
|Φ⁺⟩ = (1/√2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩)

Entanglement strength: E(x,y) = ⟨ψ(x)|H|ψ(y)⟩
```

**Fourier-domain entanglement:**
```python
freq_domain = torch.fft.rfft(transformed, dim=1)
entangled_freq = freq_domain * torch.exp(1j * entanglement_weights[i])
entangled_spatial = torch.fft.irfft(entangled_freq, n=N, dim=1)
```

### Quantum Annealing Optimization

Global optimization through quantum tunneling probability:

```
P_tunnel = exp(-ΔE / (kᵦT_quantum))

where T_quantum follows adaptive annealing schedule
```

**Temperature adaptation:**
```python
if schedule == "adaptive":
    recent_variance = np.var(energy_history[-10:])
    temperature = max(0.01, min(1.0, recent_variance))
```
